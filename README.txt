# Connect-Four-Machine-Learning
I know connect 4 is a solved game, but machine learning is interesting

Requires 3-4GB of RAM, and some time for it to learn

Eventually you will see the following:
0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 2 0 0 0

and it will be your turn to make a move by entering a number 0-6. You will be 1's and the computer 2's
